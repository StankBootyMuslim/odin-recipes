    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Dessert time! One of my all-time-favorites, brownies. This one won't take much, just a bit of sweets, flour, eggs and a little baking to get this tasty treat ready to eat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.</li>
        <li>Combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan to a 325-degree oven and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out with a few crumbs attached. Allow the brownies to cool completely before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
